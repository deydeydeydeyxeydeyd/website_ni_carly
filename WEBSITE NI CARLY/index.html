			<h1>Organic vs. Inorganic Compounds</h1>
			<div class="group">
				<h2>Water</h2>
				<p>
					Water is a compound composed of Hydrogen and Oxygen atoms connected by covalent bonds. Inorganic substances won't contain a Carbon atom, whereas organic substances contain several. Thus, water is an inorganic compound because it does not contain carbon and it was not formed by a living organism.  It has the important ability to dissolve many other substances. Indeed, the versatility of water as a solvent is essential to living organisms. 
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="group">
				<h2>Lipids</h2>
				<p>
					A lipid is one of a highly diverse group of compounds made up mostly of hydrocarbons. The few oxygen atoms they contain are often at the periphery of the molecule. Their nonpolar hydrocarbons make all lipids hydrophobic. In water, lipids do not form a true solution, but they may form an emulsion, which is the term for a mixture of solutions that do not mix well.<br><br> Lipids perform functions both within the body and in food. Within the body, lipids function as an energy reserve, regulate hormones, transmit nerve impulses, cushion vital organs, and transport fat-soluble nutrients. Fat in food serves as an energy source with high caloric density, adds texture and taste, and contributes to satiety. 
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="group">
				<h2>Acids</h2>
				<p>
					An inorganic acid (also called a mineral acid) is an acid derived from one or more inorganic compounds. All inorganic acids form hydrogen ions and the conjugate base ions when dissolved in water. Commonly used inorganic acids are sulfuric acid (H2SO4), hydrochloric acid (HCl), and nitric acid (HNO3). Used in cleaning (refining) metals, in maintenance of swimming pools, and for household cleaning. Used in car batteries and in the manufacture of fertilizers. 
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="group">
				<h2>Protiens</h2>
				<p>
					You might associate proteins with muscle tissue, but in fact, proteins are critical components of all tissues and organs. A protein is an organic molecule composed of amino acids linked by peptide bonds. Proteins include the keratin in the epidermis of skin that protects underlying tissues, and the collagen found in the dermis of skin, in bones, and in the meninges that cover the brain and spinal cord. You need protein in your diet to help your body repair cells and make new ones. <br><br>Protein is also important for growth and development in children, teens, and pregnant women.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="group">
				<h2>Sodium</h2>
				<p>
					Salt is an inorganic compound, meaning it doesn’t come from living matter. It’s made when Na (sodium) and Cl (chloride) come together to form white, crystalline cubes. Your body needs salt to function, but too little or too much salt can be harmful to your health. It is widely used in food industries as a food preservative and as a flavor enhancer. It is a major raw material in the industrial manufacturing of various chemicals such as sodium carbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate etc. In cold countries, it is used to prevent the build-up of ice on roads, bridges etc. which is important for safe driving conditions.

			<h2>The Water Cycle description</h2>
			<img src="images/water-cycle/water_cycle.jpg" alt="water cycle">
			<p>
				The water cycle describes how water evaporates from the surface of the earth, rises into the atmosphere, cools and condenses into rain or snow in clouds, and falls again to the surface as precipitation. The water falling on land collects in rivers and lakes, soil, and porous layers of rock, and much of it flows back into the oceans, where it will once more evaporate. The cycling of water in and out of the atmosphere is a significant aspect of the weather patterns on Earth.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="group">
			<h2>Evaporation</h2>
			<img src="images/water-cycle/evaporation.jpg" alt="water cycle">
			<p>
				The water cycle describes how water evaporates from the surface of the earth, rises into the atmosphere, cools and condenses into rain or snow in clouds, and falls again to the surface as precipitation. The water falling on land collects in rivers and lakes, soil, and porous layers of rock, and much of it flows back into the oceans, where it will once more evaporate. The cycling of water in and out of the atmosphere is a significant aspect of the weather patterns on Earth.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="group">
			<h2>Transpiration</h2>
			<img src="images/water-cycle/Transpiration.jpg" alt="water cycle">
			<p>
				Plants also contribute to the water cycle by releasing water vapor from their leaves into the atmosphere through a process called transpiration.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="group">
			<h2>Condensation</h2>
			<img src="images/water-cycle/condensation.jpg" alt="water cycle">
			<p>
				As water vapor rises and cools in the atmosphere, it condenses into tiny droplets, forming clouds.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="group">
			<h2>Precipitation</h2>
			<img src="images/water-cycle/precipatation.jpg" alt="water cycle">
			<p>
				When these droplets combine and grow large enough, they fall back to the Earth's surface as precipitation, which can be in the form of rain, snow, sleet, or hail <br><br> Precipitation that falls on land may flow over the surface and collect in rivers, lakes, and oceans, or it may seep into the ground, replenishing groundwater supplies.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="group">
			<h2>Runsoff</h2>
			<img src="images/water-cycle/runoff.jpg" alt="water cycle">
			<p>
				Precipitation that falls on land may flow over the surface and collect in rivers, lakes, and oceans, or it may seep into the ground, replenishing groundwater supplies.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="group">
			<h2>Infiltration and Percolation</h2>
			<img src="images/water-cycle/infiltration.jpg" alt="water cycle">
			<p>
				Some of the water that infiltrates the soil moves deeper underground, replenishing aquifers, which are natural underground reservoirs of water.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="group">
			<h2>Storage</h2>
			<img src="images/water-cycle/storage.jpg" alt="water cycle">
			<p>
				Water is stored in various forms, including ice caps, glaciers, oceans, rivers, lakes, and groundwater, until it re-enters the cycle through evaporation or other processes.
